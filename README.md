# E3372H-Scripts
A compilation of scripts for the Huawei E3372h USB modem 

## Summary 
Having recently purchased an Huawei E3372h USB modem for something like, 5 dollars? 
I was quite annoyed that it didn't have a very complete feature set! (sarcasm)

Jokes aside, I found that the lack of being able to change it from it's Hi-Link hosted mode to a more simple Stick Mode quite infuriating.

## ChangeMode.py
This will allow you to change the current operating mode of the modem.
